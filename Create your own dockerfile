PREREQUISITES:
1. You should have docker installed.
2. Use docker pull and get the container image of alpine. The command used is (docker pull alpine).
3. Confirm that docker service is active using (systemctl status docker.service). 
If it shows up as inactive start the docker service by (systemctl start docker).

Now you are ready to create your own dockerfile using alpine container image.

STEPS:
1. Create a directory named eg.Dockerfile
2. Create a file named eg.dockerfile inside the directory and copy the contents of the uploaded dockerfile.
3. Now we need to build our dockerfile, it is done using command (docker build -t {{name of the container image}} /path/to/your/dockerfile/directory).
eg. docker build -t ping-check /Dockerfile/dockerfile
4. After the image build is completed you can see your docker image using command (docker images).
5. Now you can run the docker container image using command (docker run {{ name of your container image }}).
eg. docker run ping-check - This will by default ping to google you can ping other websites or IP addresses too.
